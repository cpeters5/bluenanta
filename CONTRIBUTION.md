# Contributing to Bluenanta project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT (LICENSE.md) in the repository
State that when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT (LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cpeters5/bluenanta/issues)
Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Our project is a Django full-stack application currently using a traditional, method-based approach. 
We are open to evolving our codebase towards a more modern, object-oriented style. 
If you are interested in contributing to this transition, please feel free to submit a pull request to refactor the existing code to an object-oriented paradigm. 
This will help us maintain a clean and efficient code structure moving forward.
